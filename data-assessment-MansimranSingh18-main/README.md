# myHomes Data Assessment Albany Beck in SQL

## SQL

The file named "dataassessmentSQL.pdf" contains the written form for the SQl database. You should be able to copy and paste it into mySql.
The code will create a database called myHomes and will select it to be used.


###Query one

"Display names of representatives, details of the properties they represent, and
names of their supervisors"

The rep names and the associated properties have been listed as shown. I have intentionally not given a property to certain sales reps so that I could try using the correct join for this scenario.

### Query two

"Display details of customers together with details of their areas and names of the
managers of their areas."

As you can see information for each customer is being listed with the location details and the associated location chief (name and representative id)


## Conceptual/Logical Diagram

I have used draw.io to map out a simple and logical flow of the relationships between the entities.
